                <h2>My journey into web development</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was a kid, I have always loved to break electronics apart and put them back together. Sometimes I would just destroy an old electronic or toy to create something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always had a great passion for understanding how things work and use that knowledge to create new things. 
                    This passion helped me kick start my career and make the decision to obtain an associate degree in project management.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    As a project manager, I was able to accomplish many projects in different industries like customer service and finance. 
                    However, it was until I took a programming class in college that I discovered one of the best ways to express my passion for creating new things. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found so much satisfaction when getting my projects done and when solving coding  puzzles that made me realize that I really wanted to be in the software industry. 
                    It has not been a fast process. I have invested a lot of time in developing my skills outside of school, but what keeps me motivated is a love to learn new skills and technologies so that I can develop more efficiend and better looking web applications. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, using my knowledge and skills to solve software problems is very natural because I can connect the dots between the tools and skills I have and the problem I face problems. I have realized that the more I learn the bigger the problems I can solve and the more complex applications I can develop. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Isn't that amazing? I just simply love that. 
                </p>
